# Implementing a Secured Parking System using Biometrics and License Plate Recognition in Ateneo de Davao University

A simple Automatic License Plate Recognition developed in C# using emguCV and Tesseract built with biometrics security platform.
The project was initially designed for a private institution thus, can be used as a basis and can be a platform for learning with those who wants to develop similar systems like ours.

# Setup

Make sure to have the latest version of Visual Studio installed on your local machine. In addition, install EmguCV for C# to execute the image analysis functions. The Tesseract library is needed for the Tesseract-OCR version of this program as well.

Dependencies:

* DFDP

* EmguCV

* Tesseract

* AForge.Net

* MySql

# Summary

My approach on this project is using algorithms that are provided and most suitable for philippine license plates which are developed and studied by other researchers. There is actually a lot of research done on ALPR systems (Automatic License Plate Recognition systems) since there are many applications for these programs. After finishing the project we have concluded that our project is only efficient on the new license plate designs. So, if you plan on using this project study more on implementing it in different types of license plates.
